# Upgrading from 4.X to 5.X

## CLI `-c` option changed

In the CLI, the config file option, `-c`, used to be a list of fields and now it's expected to be a full configuration object.

## `stringify` option removed

The `stringify` option hass been removed as it was unnecesary.

## `doubleQuote` option renamed to `escapedQuote`

`doubleQuote` has been renamed to `escapedQuote`.

## Introducing new transforms instead of `unwind` and `flatten`

In the javascript Javascript modules, `transforms` are introduced and all the `unwind` and `flatten` -related options has been moved to their own transforms.

What used to be

```js
const { Parser } = require('json2csv');
const json2csvParser = new Parser({
  unwind: paths,
  unwindBlank: true,
  flatten: true,
  flattenSeparator: '__',
});
const csv = json2csvParser.parse(myData);
```

should be replaced by

```js
const {
  Parser,
  transform: { unwind, flatten },
} = require('json2csv');
const json2csvParser = new Parser({
  transforms: [unwind({ paths, blankOut: true }), flatten('__')],
});
const csv = json2csvParser.parse(myData);
```

You can se the documentation for json2csv v4.X.X [here](https://github.com/juanjoDiaz/json2csv/blob/v4/README.md).
